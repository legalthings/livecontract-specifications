# Private layer

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Documentation about the private layer is incomplete.**

The private layer is undergoing break changes to make it compatible with DIDs and to make it easier to use it without the workflow engine / live contracts.

If you're interested in using it for decentralized workflows, please visit [https://letsflow.io](https://letsflow.io).

For other uses, please contact [@ArnoldDaniels on Telegram](https://t.me/ArnoldDaniels).
