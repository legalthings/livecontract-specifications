  verifiable, decentralized digital identity.

# Decentralized identifiers \(DID\)

DIDs are unique universally resolvable identifiers. A DID represents a _subject_, which can be a person, but also an organization, object, document, etc. There is no central register that registers all DIDs. Instead, there a DID has a method that indicates how it can be resolved.

[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) are a \(draft\) W3C standard. LTO Network implements the v1.0 draft 22.

Resolving a DID results in a DID document. This document contains cryptographic material that allows the _DID controller_ to prove control of the DID.

{% hint style="info" %}
What proofing control of a DID means depends on the subject. If the DID represents a person, it allows that person to identify themselves. In case the DID represents an object, it allows a person to prove he owns that object.
{% endhint %}

DID documents do not contain other \(identifying\) information, like a name, address, etc.

#### Identity vs account

An identity isn't the same as an account. Both correspond with a blockchain address. However, an account is based on a single public/private key pair. An identity can have multiple verification methods, managed through associations. This means that an account can be generated client-side, while an identity needs to be resolved through the identity node.
{% endhint %}

## LTO Network DID method

DID with the method "**lto**" can be resolved by the LTO Network identity node.

The method-specific string is an address on the public chain. In the case of derived DIDs, it's followed by a path.

```text
lto-did = "did:lto:" lto-specific-idstring
lto-specific-string = lto-address [ ":derived:" secret ]
lto-address = 35\*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
secret = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
```

The method-specific string is case-sensitive. The address and secret are base58 encoded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Identity nodes that support [cross-chain identifiers](decentralized-identifiers-did.md#resolving-cross-chain-dids) also can also resolve the **ltox** DID method.
{% endhint %}

## Implicit identities

Any address on the LTO public chain can be represented by a DID. The DID document always contains a single verification method containing the public key of the account. This method is applicable for both authentication and assertion.

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH",
      "publicKeyBase58": "mMyJxTQuXW9bQVLmJeCrWNCSKzsEMkbZQ3xuNavj6Mk",
      "blockchainAccountId": "3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH@lto:L"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key"
  ],
  "assertionMethod": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key"
  ],
  "capabilityInvocation": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key"
  ]
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's only possible to resolve a DID for accounts that have signed at least one on-chain transaction. To generate a DID document, the public key of the address needs to be known. It's not possible to determine the public key purely based on the blockchain address.
{% endhint %}

## Constructed identities

It's possible to explicitly specify verification methods for a DID document using associations. An association with the type `0x01??` specifies that the public key of the association recipient is a valid verification method for the association sender.

The two least significant bytes from a bit-set that specifies the verification relationship.

| Hex | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0x0100 | Verification method without relationship |
| 0x0101 | Authentication |
| 0x0102 | Assertion |
| 0x0104 | Key agreement |
| 0x0108 | Capability invocation |
| 0x0110 | Capability delegation |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** To create a verification method that can be used for authentication, assertion, and key agreement, create an association with type `0x010007`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The association recipient needs to have signed at least one on-chain transaction, so the public key of that account is indexed.
{% endhint %}

There is no implicit verification relationship of the indexed public key for authentication and assertions for accounts that have at least one verification method association. By default, it can only be used as management key; to sign transactions for updating the DID document.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The management key is always listed as verification method with the capability invocation relationship. Adding alternative methods for capability invocation does not automatically make it possible to use those keys to sign blockchain transactions for updating the DID document.
{% endhint %}

The key relationship verification method only works type `X25519KeyAgreementKey2019`. The X25519 public key is generated from the ED25519 public key used to sign a transaction. In case the association recipient uses an alternative cryptographic algorithm, like ECDSA Secp256k1, the association is ignored.

## Derived identities

Itâ€™s not advisable to use a single DID for multiple purposes, for instance when issuing verifiable credentials. Correlating information might allow a party to deduce information, undermining privacy.

LTO Network supports single-use DIDs in the form of derived identities using the form `did:lto:{address}:derived:{secret}`.

The DID document of a derived identity is always the same DID document for the account, but it has a different blockchain address. See [how to create a blockchain address](../accounts.md#creating-the-address).

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH:derived:12D",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH",
      "publicKeyBase58": "mMyJxTQuXW9bQVLmJeCrWNCSKzsEMkbZQ3xuNavj6Mk",
      "blockchainAccountId": "3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH@lto:L"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key"
  ],
  "assertionMethod": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH#key"
  ]
}
```

## Cross-chain identifiers

By default, an LTO identity node will only resolve DIDs based on LTO network addresses. It's possible to configure the service to index DIDs based on addresses of other blockchains, like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

DIDs with the method "**ltox**" can be resolved by LTO Network identity nodes that support cross-chain identifiers.

The method-specific string is comprised of a [CAIP-2](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md) blockchain ID and an address on that specific chain.

> did:ltox:eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb

```text
ltox-did = "did:ltox:" chain-id ":" address
chain-id = chain-namespace + ":" + chain-reference
chain-namespace = {3,16}\*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
chain-reference = {1,47}\*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
address = {1,63}\*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
```

The method-specific string is case-sensitive.

### Supported chains

Currently, only eip155 is supported. This address scheme is used by Ethereum and other EVM-based blockchains like Binance Smart Chain.

### Resolving cross-chain DIDs

The identity node can generate addresses for external blockchains.

DID documents will contain an `alsoKnownAs` property, containing DIDs for LTO Network and for other chains indexed by the identity node.

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:ltox:eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb",
  "alsoKnownAs": [
    "did:lto:3JugjxT51cTjWAsgnQK4SpmMqK6qua1VpXH",
    "did:ltox:bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93:128Lkh3S7CkDTBZ8W7BbpsN3YYizJMp8p6"
  ]
