## Transaction Fees

Transaction fees act as a reward for the miner. Because these are the only rewards, this prevents inflation of the network since no new tokens are introduced.

| Transaction | Fee \(LTO\) | Minimum \(LTO\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Transfer | 1 | 0.01 |
| Lease | 1 | 0.01 |
| Cancel Lease | 1 | 0.01 |
| Mass Transfer | 1 + 0.1 \* N | 0.01 + 0.001 \* N |
| Anchor | 0.3 + 0.05 \* N | 0.01 + 0.001 \* N |
| Invoke Association | 0.35 | 0.01 |
| Revoke Association | 0.35 | 0.01 |
| Sponsor | 5 | 0.1 |
| Cancel Sponsor | 1 | 0.01 |
| Script | 5 | 0.1 |

The absolute minimum fees are enforced by the consensus model. The current fees are configured by the nodes as the minimum acceptable fee.

Nodes will reject broadcasting transactions that offer a lower fee than configured. However, when running your own node, it's possible to offer any fee equal to or above the minimum. Mining nodes will not process transactions with a fee that's lower than configured, so likely these transactions will stay in the utx pool until your own node is able to mine or until they time out \(after 90 minutes\).

### Fee distribution

For every transaction, 20% of the fee isn't awarded and thus effectively taken out of circulation \(aka burned\). The remaining fee is split up among the current leader, and the next elected node at a ratio of  2:3.

The fee is distributed 32% to the leader, 48% to the next one, and 20% is burned.

For more information see the [NG documentation on Waves.](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol)

### Sponsored accounts

Normally the fee is automatically deducted from the sender's address. With sponsored accounts, it's possible for a third party to pay for all transaction fees of an account.

If the sponsor has insufficient funds, the fee is deducted from the sender's account. This prevents a third party to disable an account through a dummy sponsorship.

If an account has multiple sponsors, it works as last in first out. If the most recently added sponsor has insufficient funds, the next sponsor is tried, this continues until the sender's account is charged for the fee.

### Sponsored transactions

By default the account that signs the transaction also pays the transaction fees. It's possible for a different account to pay the fee instead this account needs to co-sign the transaction and add it as proof.

_This is a zero-anchor transaction to register  `did:lto:3Jq8mnhRquuXCiFUwTLZFVSzmQt3Fu6F7HQ`. The transaction fee is paid by account `3JiPMnx485EVhasHfD4f36v4Hydmn7XYFFo`._

The account that sponsors a transaction, can be a sponsored account. In that case, the fee will be paid by the account's sponsor.

## Signing a transaction

`ED25519` is used for all the signatures in the project.

The process is as follows: create the special bytes for signing \(for transaction or block, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ltonetwork/documentation/tree/c01951988c8797dc36ac6098133b139eaffade7c/technical-details/data-structures.md)\), then create a signature using these bytes and the private key bytes.

For the validation of signature is enough signature bytes, signed object bytes and the public key.

Do not forget that there are many valid \(not unique!\) signatures for a one array of bytes \(block or transaction\). Also you should not assume that the id of block or transaction is unique. The collision can occur one day! They have already taken place for some weak keys.

## Proofs

Proofs are a flexible way to authorize a transaction. Each proof is a Base58 encoded byte string and can be a signature, a secret, or anything else â€“ the semantics of the proof is dictated by the smart contract that interprets it. There can be up to 8 proofs at most 64 bytes each.

By default, only one proof is used, which must be the transaction signature by the sender. It should be the very first element in the proofs array, while all the other elements are ignored. The JSON looks like

`"proofs": [ "21jgWvYq6XZuke2bLE8bQEbdXJEk..." ]`

## Calculating Transaction Id

Transaction Id is not stored in the transaction bytes. It can be easily calculated from the bytes for signing using `blake2b256(bytes_for_signing)`.
