## LTO Network Anchor Node

The LTO anchor node is comprised of a set of two [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. For development, use _docker compose_ as orchestration tool.

### Docker Desktop

{% hint style="success" %}
1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).
2. Double-click `Docker Desktop for Windows Installer.exe` to run the installer.
3. Docker does not start automatically. To start it, search for `Docker` and select _Docker Desktop for Windows_ in the search results.
{% endhint %}

For more detailed instructions please read the [Installation guide in the Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

_Docker Desktop includes docker compose, so it's not needed to install that separately._
