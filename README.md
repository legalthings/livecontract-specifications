# Getting started

[LTO Network](https://ltonetwork.com) is a hybrid blockchain designed for easy integration of business applications, aimed at breaking data silos that so many organizations face today, using _Live Contracts_. It has a private layer that utilizes a public blockchain for consensus.&#x20;

## Buying and staking LTO

Transactions on the LTO blockchain need LTO tokens to get you started. We summarized tutorials for the most commonly used exchanges, detailing all the necessary steps on _'how to buy LTO tokens'_.&#x20;

What comes after your purchase? Staking, of course! LTO offers a competitive APY in form of staking rewards, so let us walk you through the process of putting your LTO tokens to work by staking them with an LTO network community node.

## Mining

LTO's eco-friendly mining mechanism relies on _Leased-Proof-of-Stake_, a variant of the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. The easiest way to get started is to run your own validator node and stake LTO tokens.&#x20;

In our mining tutorials, we cover the basics about running your own LTO node, chances of generating blocks, the process of becoming an LTO network community node, and distributing block rewards to your node's stakers.

## Anchoring

Anchoring on a blockchain is a simple and cheap way to notarize documents or timestamp data. By adding a hash on the blockchain, data becomes tamper-proof.

Integrating anchoring is relatively simple and should take between a couple of hours and a few days depending on the complexity of your application.

## Live Contracts

A Live Contract is an agreement between organizations that contains both on-chain and off-chain instructions. Live Contracts enable cross-organizational workflows without the need for a central system or trusted party.

Start with the tutorial, which takes you through be basic concepts and as you get familiar with writing and testing workflow scenarios.
