# Configuration

Before you run the public node you will need to configure a few environment variables:

* `LTO_WALLET_SEED`: The seed of your wallet. Your account will need at least 1000 LTO to be able to start mining. Alternatively, you can use `LTO_WALLET_SEED_BASE58` with base58 encoded wallet seed.
* `LTO_NETWORK`: Choose the network you want to connect your node to. The options are: `MAINNET` and `TESTNET` (default is`MAINNET`).

For other options check out: [Public Node on Github](https://github.com/ltonetwork/lto-public-node)
