# LTO wallet

To easily interact with the LTO Network blockchain, multiple wallets have been developed.

### Official Web UI

The official wallet web app is available at [https://wallet.lto.network](https://wallet.lto.network) and enables users to:

* Generate a **new seed phrase** \(new wallet keys\) or **connect a Ledger Device**
* Transfer native LTO coins to an address
* Lease native LTO coins to an address
* Anchor document hashes to the LTO Network blockchain
* Utilize the bridge \(swap to other networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain\)
