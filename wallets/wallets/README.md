# LTO Wallet

To easily interact with the LTO Network blockchain, multiple wallets have been developed.

### Official Web UI

The official wallet web app is available at [https://wallet.lto.network](https://wallet.lto.network) and enables users to:

* Generate a **new seed phrase** \(new wallet keys\) or **connect a Ledger Device**
* Transfer native LTO coins to an address
* Lease native LTO coins to an address
* Anchor document hashes to the LTO Network blockchain
* Utilize the bridge \(swap to other networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain\)

### Official Web UI \(Ledger\)

This is the same official wallet web app as described above, but allows you to connect with a Ledger device.  
The same actions are available, but require a physical action on your Ledger device to sign the transactions.

### How to install the LTO app on your Ledger device

In case you haven't installed the LTO app on your Ledger device, you can follow the instructions on the page below.
