### Interface

The interface is exactly the same as described on the [Official Web UI](wallet-web-app.md) page. The only addition while using a Ledger device is that it requires to sign transactions by physically touching your Ledger device.

### Signing transactions

On-chain actions need to be signed with your keys, and will therefore need the Ledger to be connected.  
After you click Send / Lease or any other action, it will prompt you to sign with the Ledger device.

In case you want to sign the transaction, acknowledge the signing process on your Ledger device with "accept and send".
