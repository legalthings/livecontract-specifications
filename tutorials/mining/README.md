# Mining

Contrary to a lot of cryptos you don't need GPUs or ASICs to mine LTO. Similar to many PoS tokens the most important prerequisite is a computer with a good bandwidth connection, e.g., a VPS, your home server, or even your PC. You will find lots of tutorials on setting up a node in our public node section:

Since setting up a node and running it for mining LTO can open up its own set of questions we further summed up best practices for you to explore on the following pages:

{% page-ref page="prepare-setup-your-wallet.md" %}

{% page-ref page="node-management.md" %}

Lastly, should you at some point decide you want to become an official community node and offer your node up for staking to everybody in the community here is a roadmap for you to follow:

Should you need more advice on topics not covered in our tutorial feel free to ask in the [LTO tech chat](https://t.me/LTOtech)!
